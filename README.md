### Streamlit
```bash

 ```

## How the data is structured
### ratings.csv
- userId: We assume that we can have multiple users
- categoryId: The main category of tags used to generate the picture (we need integer type here)
- rating: The rating that the user gave to the picture (1-10)
- tags: The tags that model used to generate the picture (separated by '|')

### categories.csv
- id: ID of the category
- name: Name of the category

## What not to forget
- The current ratings.csv and categories.csv were generated by ChatGPT - We should replace them later
- Implement adding new users (id, name)
- Implement generating e.g. 10 pictures with one click (not only one)
- Generated images should contain best rated tags and tags that are not rated yet
  
## Running app
- From inside streamlit_frontend directory run "streamlit run main.py"
